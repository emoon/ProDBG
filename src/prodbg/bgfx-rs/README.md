=======

Rust wrapper around [bgfx], providing a clean, safe API for rust applications.

*Please read the [crate documentation][docs] for build requirements and crate
limitations before using.*

[API Documentation][docs]

### Examples

To run the examples, invoke them through cargo:

```
cargo run --example 00-helloworld
cargo run --example 01-cubes
```

**OSX Note:** There is currently no really clean way to exit the examples in
OSX, and closing the window may in fact cause a crash. This is due to
limitations in [glutin][glutin] (specifically [#468] and [#520]). This only
effects the examples, and not the crate itself. The best way of closing them
is to simply `Ctrl-C` in the console.
